# InstaMaker

Currently a work in progress, but it is a working work in progress.

## Why???

Because I follow the exact same workflow when making Instagram posts for an account I'm managing. I have been using Canva to make things as simple as possible but I wanted to make something that was more tailored to my needs and optimised for my workflow.

## Installation

For now you will have to clone the repo and build it yourself. It's a simple electron app built with Vue/Vite so it should be pretty easy to get up and running.

```npm install``` to install

```npm run dev``` to run in dev mode

```npm run build``` to build the application
